# Bootcamp Challenge 01 - HTML CSS Git: Code Refactor

This project required to take existing code and refactor it to meet the minimum acceptance criteria associated to an
**user story described below**. A main focus of the project is to ensure minimum Web accessibility compliance to enable
people with disabilities or socio-economic restrictions have access to this website.

## User Story

AS A marketing agency I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards SO THAT our own site is optimized for
search engines

## (minimum) Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards WHEN I view the source code THEN I find semantic HTML elements WHEN I view
the structure of the HTML elements THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and
positioning WHEN I view the image elements THEN I find accessible alt attributes WHEN I view the heading attributes THEN
they fall in sequential order WHEN I view the title element THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

## Additional improvements

As part of this effort, I included the following additional improvements:

-   Ensured that all links are functioning correctly.
-   Cleaned up the CSS to make it more efficient
-   Consolidated CSS selectors and properties.
-   Organized CSS to follow the semantic structure of the HTML elements.
-   Added comments before each element or section of the page for the index.html and style.css files.
-   Added basic LICENSE file.
-   Added .gitignore file
